//My pre-paid cell phone plan is $35 a month from Virgin Mobile. There are other plans from different providers. Straight Talk which includes better phones and same coverage for $45 a month and Boost Mobile with better phones and coverage for $50 a month. I need to calculate how much extra money it would cost annually for the more expensive plans compared to my current plan.
