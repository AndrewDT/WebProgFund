/*Criteria:
Make sure each of the sub-projects follows this list of criteria:
As in the Expressions assignment you will need to create code that calculates a result. You can not use the same formulas or code used in that previous assignment, however.
Decide what your code will calculate. This should be an original calculation. In other words you may not use any of the examples mentioned in this class. This will result in an automatic 0.
Your calculation should use a minimum of two factors or givens.
At least two factors must be essential for the calculation. If one of the factors (the pieces of information you are collecting with the prompts) is not needed in order to calculate the result then it is not essential.
There should be a minimum of two prompts to collect user information. The prompts should include labels so the user knows what information they need to enter. These prompts should assign the information collected into variables you have set up.
Write the givens as appropriately named variables.
Declare a variable for the resulting value of the calculation.
Calculate the result using the variables in an expression (NOT the literal values or numbers)
Assign the calculation to the resulting variable.
The result should appear in the browser's console. (Remember to include units like “square feet” or "meters cubed"). This should explain the result as well.

Problem: Check the Login
Make sure the user has the correct username and password. If the username doesn’t match then a specific message for that should be printed to the console. If the password doesn’t match a message should appear for that, etc. Only one error message should appear.
Given:
Username entered by user
Password entered by user
Correct username
Correct password
Result To Print Out:
“Welcome, (place their username here)!”  - if the username and password is correct
“User not found. Try again.” -if the username does not match
“Password does not match our records.”  -if the username matches but the password does not
