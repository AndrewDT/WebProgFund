//Each person has a Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). Assuming all users are male and given weight in pounds(lbs), height, and age calculate the BMR of a specific male

//Givens: Weight in Pounds(lbs) / Height / Age

//Result Variable: BMR of a specific Male

//Result to Print: "Based on your weight of Xkg (kilograms), height of Xcm, and age of x years, your Basil Metabolic Rate (BMR) is x calories a day."
