/*Criteria:

Make sure each of the sub-projects follows this list of criteria:
As in the earlier assignments you will need to create code that calculates a result. You may not use the same formulas or code used in previous assignments.
Decide what your code will calculate. This should be an original calculation. In other words you may not use any of the examples mentioned in this class. This will result in an automatic 0.
Information should be collected from the user with prompts
Calculate the result using the variables in an expression (NOT the literal values or numbers)
The result should appear in the browser's console. (Remember to include units like “square feet” or "meters cubed"). This should explain the result as well.
Use a function as part of your code in each sub-project. This function should have at least two parameters and return a value.
 
Each of the following requirements must exist in at least one of the 3 subprojects:
A ternary 
An else if
An anonymous function
A normal "named" function
An expression with two arithmetic operators
A function with three parameters.
At least one logical operator

Problem:
As a personal trainer, it is important for me to know a person's one rep max when lifting weight so I can fine tune their workout plan with different weight percentages. Calculate your one rep max based on the weight lifted in pounds for 4 - 6 reps and how much that percentage is of your one rep max.

Parameters:
User's weight
User's One Rep Max

Result:
"Your One Rep Max is Xlbs based on your current load of Xlbs for 4 - 6 reps. You are lifting at X% of your One Rep Max."
*/
var weightInPounds = prompt("Please enter the weight you are lifting for in pounds \n (We will convert this to Kilograms)");
if(weightInPounds === "" || weightInPounds <90){
	weightInPounds = prompt("A VALID WEIGHT IS NECESSARY TO CALCULATE YOUR ONE REP MAX");
}

var calcOneRM = function(weightInPounds){
	weightInKilos = weightInPounds/2.205;
	calcOneRM = (weightInKilos * 1.1307) + 0.6998;
	return calcOneRM;
}

var oneRMResult = calcOneRM(weightInPounds);

var calcPercentage = function(weightInPounds, oneRMResult){
	weightInKilos = weightInPounds/2.205;
	calcPercentage = weightInKilos/oneRMResult*100;
	return calcPercentage;
}

var result = calcPercentage(weightInPounds, oneRMResult);
console.log("Your One Rep Max is " + oneRMResult + "kgs based on your current load of " + weightInPounds + "lbs for 4 - 6 reps. You are lifting at " + result + "% of your One Rep Max.");
