//My pre-paid cell phone plan is $35 a month from Virgin Mobile. There are other plans from different providers. Straight Talk which includes better phones and same coverage for $45 a month and Boost Mobile with better phones and coverage for $50 a month. I need to calculate how much extra money it would cost annually for the more expensive plans compared to my current plan.

//Givens: Virgin Mobile Plan Cost / Straight Talk Plan Cost / Boost Mobile Plan Cost

//Result Variable: The compared cost of each plan

//Result to Print: "The Virgin Mobile plan costs $X annually, which is $X cheaper than the Straight Talk plan's cost of $X, and $X cheaper than the Boost Mobile plan's cost of $X."
