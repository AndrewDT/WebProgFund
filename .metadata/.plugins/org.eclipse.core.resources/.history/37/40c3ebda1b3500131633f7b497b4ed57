Problem: Movie Ticket Price

The local movie theater in town has a ticket price of $12.00 but if you are a senior (55 and older), under 10 you get the discounted price of $7.00. In addition, if a customer is seeing a movie between 3pm and 5pm they can also get the discounted price. 
Determine which of the two prices the customer is eligible for.
Given:
Time of Movie (Assume whole numbers here)
Age of the customer
 Result To Print Out:
“The ticket price is X”
*/

var movieTime = 2;// Variable for the given movieTime and can be assigned multiple values for use in the later if and else statements
var customerAge = 9;// Variable for the given customerAge and can be assigned multiple values for use in the later if and else statements

var price = 12.00;// Variable for the regular ticket price assigned the given value of 12.00
var discountPrice = 7.00;// Variable for the discount ticket price assigned the given value of 7.00

var discountAge = customerAge < 10 || customerAge >= 55;// Variable that is assigned a set of values within restraints to determine whether a customer's age fits the given criteria for discount pricing and for use in the later if and else statement
var discountTime = movieTime > 3 && movieTime < 5;// Variable that is assigned a set of values within restraints to determine whether the movie time fits the given criteria for discount pricing and for use in the later if and else statement

// If discountAge or discountTime is TRUE, print to console "The ticket price is $7.00"
// Else, if neither discountAge or discountTime are true, print to console "The ticket price is $12.00"
if(discountAge || discountTime){
	console.log("The ticket price is $" + discountPrice);
}else{
	console.log("The ticket price is $" + price);
}
