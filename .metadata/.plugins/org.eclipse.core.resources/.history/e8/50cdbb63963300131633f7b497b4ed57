//Conditional Logic Concepts
//Conditional Statement:
/*
if(CONDITION){
 ACTIONS
}

sunny=true
if(sunny){
	goToTheBeach();
}ELSE{
	goToTheMovies();
}
 */


//Logic Concepts
/* Comparison:
 temp = 82;//True or 62 false because of if
 if(temp > 70){
 	goToTheBeach();
 }
 
 >(Greater than), <(Less Than), >=(Greater Than or Equal To), <=(Less Than or Equal To), !=(Not Equal to), ==(Equal To)
one = is for assignment two are for comparing the values 
 
 */

//Nesting Conditionals
/*
 if(sunny){
 	goToTheBeach();
 	
 	 if(warmWater){
 	wearNewSuit();
 }
 }else{
 	goToTheMovies();
 }

 Make sure if one action depends on another it is nested in the conditional statement as goToTheBeach and wearNewSuit

//Conditionals Examples
/*
 var oldEnough = true;
 
 Good to write in english first
 //if the child is old enough, print to the console "you can ride!"
 Curly brace best practice is same line as if statement
 Basic condition has two parts : Condition and Code block
 if(oldEnough){
 	 //code performed if condition is true
 	console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
 }
 console.log("what comes after")//if conditional is false, code keeps on going
 */


//Relational Expressions
/*
 var kidHeight = 40;
 var minHeight = 48;
 //if the child is old enough, print to the console "you can ride!"
 //if the kid is over 48 inches in height
 if(kidHeight > minHeight){
 	console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
 }
 */


//Condition with Expressions

/*
 var kidHeight = 47;
 var minHeight = 48;
 var sneakerLift = 2;
 //if the child is old enough, print to the console "you can ride!"
 //if the kid is over 48 inches in height
 if(kidHeight + sneakerLift > minHeight){
 	console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
 }
 */

//If and Else
/*
 var kidHeight = 52;
 var minHeight = 48;
 //if the child is old enough, print to the console "you can ride!"
 //if the kid is over 48 inches in height
 if(kidHeight > minHeight){
 	console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
 }
 if(kidHeight <= minHeight){
 	console.log("Sorry kid, you've got some growing to do first!");
 }
