//Examples:

/* Problem: Calculate the area of a rectangle given the width and height of the rectangle.
Givens:
The width of the rectangle
The height of the rectangle.
Result Variable:
The area of the rectangle.
Result to Print:
“The circumference of the circle is x”;
Example problem as it should appear in your code.
//Calculate the Circumference of a Circle
var radius = 6;
const PI = 3.14159265;
//multiply 2, PI and the radius & assign to circ variable.
var circ = radius * 2 * PI;
//print out the output circumference
console.log(“The circumference of the circle is “ + circ );
Problems:

Dog Years

Dogs age 7 times faster than humans so a dog that is 1 year old in human years is 7 years old in “dog years.”  Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age.
     Givens:
Sparky’s age.
     Result Varable:
Sparky’s age in dog years.
    Result to Print:
“Sparky is X human years old which is X in dog years.



//Calculate Sparky the pit bull's age in dog years

var sparkyHumanYears = 4;// Setting up the variable for Sparky's age in human years
var sparkyDogYears = 7;// Setting up the variable for Sparky's age in dog years
var result = "Sparky is " + sparkyHumanYears + " human years old which is " + sparkyHumanYears * sparkyDogYears + " in dog years.";// Setting up the variable with an expression and strings for the result of Sparky's age in dog years based on how old his is in human years
console.log(result);// Printing the result variable to the console

/* Slice of Pie part 1

A bunch of students are having a party and somebody ordered pizza. Create an expression that calculates how much pizza each partygoer will get at the party.  (Assume all pizzas have the same number of slices and that the person dividing the pizza is really precise, so this can be a decimal, like 3.52 slices, etc.)
     Given:
Number of slices per pizza
Number of people at the party
Number of pizzas ordered.
     Result Variables:
Number of slices per person. (Can be a decimal or floating point).
    Result to Print:
“Each person ate X slices of pizza at the party.”


//Calulate how much pizza each partygoer will get at the party

var slicesPerPizza = 4.56;// Setting up the variable for how many slices there are for each pizza
var peopleAtTheParty = 12;// Setting up the variable for how many people are at the party
var pizzasOrdered = 7;// Setting up the variable for how many pizzas were ordered
var totalNumberOfSlices = pizzasOrdered * slicesPerPizza;// Setting up the variable with the expression that gives the total number of slices of pizza based on the total number of pizzas ordered
var result = "Each person ate " + totalNumberOfSlices / peopleAtTheParty + " slices of pizza at the party";// Setting up the variable with an expression and strings to give the total number of slices each partygoer will get based on the number of people and total number of pizza slices
console.log(result);// Printing the result variable to the console

/* Slice of Pie part II

At the pizza party Sparky, the host’s dog is excited, because he gets the leftover pizza after the slices have been divided up evenly among the guests. Assume guests get whole slices, how many whole slices will Sparky feast on?
Example data set: 10 people, 4 pizzas and 8 slices per pizza will mean each person eats 3 slices and Sparky gets 2 slices. (Note that this is an example, your code should work and give me the accurate results no matter what numbers I put in for those given variables.)
     Given:
Don’t make new given variables/constants for this. Instead use the givens you set up for Slice of Pie I.
     Result Variables:
Number of slices Sparky gets to eat.
    Result to Print:
“Sparky got X slices of pizza.”

//Calculate how many leftover whole slices of pizza Sparky will recieve

var slicesPerPizza = 4;// Setting up the variable for how many slices there are for each pizza
var peopleAtTheParty = 12;// Setting up the variable for how many people are at the party
var pizzasOrdered = 7;// Setting up the variable for how many pizzas were ordered
var totalNumberOfSlices = pizzasOrdered * slicesPerPizza;// Setting up the variable with the expression that gives the total number of slices of pizza based on the total number of pizzas ordered
var result = "Sparky got " + totalNumberOfSlices % peopleAtTheParty + " slices of pizza";// Setting up the variable with an expression and strings to give the total remaining number of leftover whole slices Sparky will get after each partygoer receives their amount of pizza
console.log(result);// Printing the result variable to the console

/* Average shopping bill

You are budgeting your money for the year and must calculate your average weekly grocery shopping spending over the past five weeks. Store the past five grocery totals as a list in an array. Create an expression that will use the items in the array to calculate the average amount spent on groceries.
Please note: there should only be one given for this problem set, the array holding the five weekly totals.  You should be able to access the array using the array access notation discussed earlier in the course.
     Givens:
An array with five weekly grocery totals.
     Result Variable:
Total amount spent on groceries.
Average weekly grocery spending.
    Result to Print:
“You have spent a total of $X on groceries over 5 weeks. That is an average of $X per week”
*/

//Calculate the average weekly grocery shopping spending over the past five weeks

var weeklyGroceryTotals = [50, 77, 60, 55, 53];
