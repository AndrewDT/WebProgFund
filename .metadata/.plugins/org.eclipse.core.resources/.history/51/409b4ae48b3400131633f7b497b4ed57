Problem: Movie Ticket Price

The local movie theater in town has a ticket price of $12.00 but if you are a senior (55 and older), under 10 you get the discounted price of $7.00. In addition, if a customer is seeing a movie between 3pm and 5pm they can also get the discounted price. 
Determine which of the two prices the customer is eligible for.
Given:
Time of Movie (Assume whole numbers here)
Age of the customer
 Result To Print Out:
“The ticket price is X”
*/

var movieTime;
var customerAge = 54;

var price = 12.00;
var discountPrice = 7.00;

var discountAge = customerAge < 10 || customerAge >= 55;

if(discountAge){
	console.log("The ticket price is $" + discountPrice);
}
