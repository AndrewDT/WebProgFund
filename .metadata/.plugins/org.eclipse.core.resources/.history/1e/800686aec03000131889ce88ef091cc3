Problems:

Dog Years

Dogs age 7 times faster than humans so a dog that is 1 year old in human years is 7 years old in “dog years.”  Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age.
     Givens:
Sparky’s age.
     Result Varable:
Sparky’s age in dog years.
    Result to Print:
“Sparky is X human years old which is X in dog years.



//Calculate Sparky the pit bull's age in dog years

var sparkyHumanYears = 4;// Setting up the variable for Sparky's age in human years
var sparkyDogYears = 7;// Setting up the variable for Sparky's age in dog years
var result = "Sparky is " + sparkyHumanYears + " human years old which is " + sparkyHumanYears * sparkyDogYears + " in dog years.";// Setting up the variable with an expression and strings for the result of Sparky's age in dog years based on how old his is in human years

/* Slice of Pie part 1

A bunch of students are having a party and somebody ordered pizza. Create an expression that calculates how much pizza each partygoer will get at the party.  (Assume all pizzas have the same number of slices and that the person dividing the pizza is really precise, so this can be a decimal, like 3.52 slices, etc.)
     Given:
Number of slices per pizza
Number of people at the party
Number of pizzas ordered.
     Result Variables:
Number of slices per person. (Can be a decimal or floating point).
    Result to Print:
“Each person ate X slices of pizza at the party.”


//Calulate how much pizza each partygoer will get at the party

var slicesPerPizza = 4.56;// Setting up the variable for how many slices there are for each pizza
var peopleAtTheParty = 12;// Setting up the variable for how many people are at the party
var pizzasOrdered = 7;// Setting up the variable for how many pizzas were ordered
var totalNumberOfSlices = pizzasOrdered * slicesPerPizza;// Setting up the variable with the expression that gives the total number of slices of pizza based on the total number of pizzas ordered
var result = "Each person ate " + totalNumberOfSlices / peopleAtTheParty + " slices of pizza at the party";// Setting up the variable with an expression and strings to give the total number of slices each partygoer will get based on the number of people and total number of pizza slices
console.log(result);// Printing the result variable to the console

/* Slice of Pie part II

At the pizza party Sparky, the host’s dog is excited, because he gets the leftover pizza after the slices have been divided up evenly among the guests. Assume guests get whole slices, how many whole slices will Sparky feast on?
Example data set: 10 people, 4 pizzas and 8 slices per pizza will mean each person eats 3 slices and Sparky gets 2 slices. (Note that this is an example, your code should work and give me the accurate results no matter what numbers I put in for those given variables.)
     Given:
Don’t make new given variables/constants for this. Instead use the givens you set up for Slice of Pie I.
     Result Variables:
Number of slices Sparky gets to eat.
    Result to Print:
“Sparky got X slices of pizza.”

//Calculate how many leftover whole slices of pizza Sparky will recieve

var slicesPerPizza = 4;// Setting up the variable for how many slices there are for each pizza
var peopleAtTheParty = 12;// Setting up the variable for how many people are at the party
var pizzasOrdered = 7;// Setting up the variable for how many pizzas were ordered
var totalNumberOfSlices = pizzasOrdered * slicesPerPizza;// Setting up the variable with the expression that gives the total number of slices of pizza based on the total number of pizzas ordered
var result = "Sparky got " + totalNumberOfSlices % peopleAtTheParty + " slices of pizza";// Setting up the variable with an expression and strings to give the total remaining number of leftover whole slices Sparky will get after each partygoer receives their amount of pizza

/* Average shopping bill

You are budgeting your money for the year and must calculate your average weekly grocery shopping spending over the past five weeks. Store the past five grocery totals as a list in an array. Create an expression that will use the items in the array to calculate the average amount spent on groceries.
Please note: there should only be one given for this problem set, the array holding the five weekly totals.  You should be able to access the array using the array access notation discussed earlier in the course.
     Givens:
An array with five weekly grocery totals.
     Result Variable:
Total amount spent on groceries.
Average weekly grocery spending.
    Result to Print:
“You have spent a total of $X on groceries over 5 weeks. That is an average of $X per week”


//Calculate the average weekly grocery shopping spending over the past five weeks

var weeklyGroceryTotals = [50, 77, 60, 55, 53];// Creating an array to hold the total spent on groceries each week for 5 weeks
var completeGroceryTotal = (weeklyGroceryTotals[0] + weeklyGroceryTotals[1] + weeklyGroceryTotals[2] + weeklyGroceryTotals[3] + weeklyGroceryTotals[4]);// Creating a variable that is assigned the complete total of groceries for the 5 weeks based on an expression that adds each array item up into a total
var result = "You have spent a total of $" + completeGroceryTotal + " on groceries over 5 weeks." + " That is an average of $" + completeGroceryTotal/5 + " per week";// Creating a result variable that contains strings and the expression that calculates the average of the 5 week grocery sum (completeGroceryTotal)

/*Discounts

Calculate the discounted price for an item. Create an expression that will calculate the discounted price with and without sales tax. (It is acceptable for the result to have more than two digits after the decimal. $345.896 for example.)
     Givens:
Original price
Discount percentage (20% would be 20, for example)
Description of item
Sales tax percentage
     Result Variables:
Price of the item with tax
Price of the item without tax
     Result to Print:
“Your X was originally $X, but after a X% discount, it is now $X without tax, and $X with tax.”

//Calculate the discounted price for an item

var description = "Supplement";// Creating a variable for the item's description
var salesTax = .07;// Creating a variable for the applicable sales tax on the item

var priceWithoutTax = originalPrice - originalPrice/discount;// Creating a variable with an expression that gives the price of the item without tax by subtracting the result of the division of originalPrice and discount variables from the originalPrice variable
var priceWithTax = priceWithoutTax + originalPrice*salesTax;// Creating a variable with an expression that gives the price of the item with tax by adding the priceWithoutTax variable to result of the variables orginalPrice multiplied by salesTax
