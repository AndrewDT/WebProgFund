//Andrew Tillett 10/21/13 Functions Worksheet Circumference Problem

/*Criteria:
For each solution you will need the following:
Comment each line of code appropriately. Comment, comment, comment!
Write the givens as variables, and pass the givens to the function using arguments.
The calcultions should be within the functions and the function should return the result to the result variable.
Create a variable for your result (don’t forget!)
Print the result using the result variable and the appropriate message outside the function. (Do not print from the functions you create)
There should be a minimum of 20 commits to your git repository.
This should all be done in a single project and single .as file.


Example:
Calculate the area of a rectangle given the width and height of the rectangle.
//Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
var width = 5;
var height = 6;
var area = calculateArea(width, height);
console.log(“The Area of the Rectangle is “ + area);
private function calculateArea(w, h ):Number
{
     return w *h;
}

Problem: Circumference - 2*PI*R

Calculate the circumference of a circle.
Parameter(s) for function:
Radius of the circle
Return:
Circumference of the circle
Result to print to the console:
“The circumference of the circle is X”;
*/
var radius = 4;
var pi = 3.141592;
var circumference = calculateCircumference(2*pi*radius);
function calculateCircumference(radius){
	return 2*pi*radius;
}
