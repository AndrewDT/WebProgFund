//Andrew Tillett 10/22/13 Assignment Functions: Function Personal

/*Criteria:

Make sure each of the sub-projects follows this list of criteria:
As in the earlier assignments you will need to create code that calculates a result. You may not use the same formulas or code used in previous assignments.
Decide what your code will calculate. This should be an original calculation. In other words you may not use any of the examples mentioned in this class. This will result in an automatic 0.
Information should be collected from the user with prompts
Calculate the result using the variables in an expression (NOT the literal values or numbers)
The result should appear in the browser's console. (Remember to include units like “square feet” or "meters cubed"). This should explain the result as well.
Use a function as part of your code in each sub-project. This function should have at least two parameters and return a value.
 
Each of the following requirements must exist in at least one of the 3 subprojects:
A ternary
An else if
An anonymous function
A normal "named" function
An expression with two arithmetic operators
A function with three parameters.
At least one logical operator


Problem:
When working, there are always a number of deadlines to meet. Calculate to see if you can meet your work's deadline based on work load, time spent working per day, and days left until deadline.

Parameters:
Workload
Time spent working
Days left until deadline
*/


var result = calcHours(350, 17, 14);
console.log(result);


function calcHours(workLoad, timeSpentWorking, daysLeft){
	var calcHours = workLoad - (timeSpentWorking*3)
	return calcHours;
}
