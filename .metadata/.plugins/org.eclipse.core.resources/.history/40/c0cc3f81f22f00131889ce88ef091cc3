var age;

Declaring is like making a box

 RULES:
 Avoid Special Characters for Variables
 Use only letters, numbers and/or underscores
 Do not begin with numbers
 
 CONVENTIONS:
 Names should be relevant and meaningful
 Use "camel case" aka camelCase
 Begin with lower case letters

/* Start of Defining Variables Screencast Example
 
var age; //declaration MUST COME first
age = 20; //defition MUST COME second

// storage container = value

var yearOfBirth = 1992; //declaring and defining on the same line

//spaces do not affect function, however, do not haphazardly space (except for KEYWORDS and VARIABLE words)
