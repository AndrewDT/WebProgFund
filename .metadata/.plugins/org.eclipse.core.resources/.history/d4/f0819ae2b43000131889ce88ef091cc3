//Examples:

/* Problem: Calculate the area of a rectangle given the width and height of the rectangle.
Givens:
The width of the rectangle
The height of the rectangle.
Result Variable:
The area of the rectangle.
Result to Print:
“The circumference of the circle is x”;
Example problem as it should appear in your code.
//Calculate the Circumference of a Circle
var radius = 6;
const PI = 3.14159265;
//multiply 2, PI and the radius & assign to circ variable.
var circ = radius * 2 * PI;
//print out the output circumference
console.log(“The circumference of the circle is “ + circ );
Problems:

Dog Years

Dogs age 7 times faster than humans so a dog that is 1 year old in human years is 7 years old in “dog years.”  Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age.
     Givens:
Sparky’s age.
     Result Varable:
Sparky’s age in dog years.
    Result to Print:
“Sparky is X human years old which is X in dog years.

*/

//Calculate Sparky the pit bull's age in dog years

var sparkyHumanYears = 1;
var sparkyDogYears = 7;
var result = "Sparky is" + sparkyHumanYears + "human years old which is" + sparkyHumanYears * sparkyDogYears + "in dog years.";
console.log(result);
