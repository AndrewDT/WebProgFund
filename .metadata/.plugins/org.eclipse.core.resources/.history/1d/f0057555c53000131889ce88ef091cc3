var weeklyGroceryTotals = [50, 77, 60, 55, 53];// Creating an array to hold the total spent on groceries each week for 5 weeks
var completeGroceryTotal = (weeklyGroceryTotals[0] + weeklyGroceryTotals[1] + weeklyGroceryTotals[2] + weeklyGroceryTotals[3] + weeklyGroceryTotals[4]);// Creating a variable that is assigned the complete total of groceries for the 5 weeks based on an expression that adds each array item up into a total
var result = "You have spent a total of $" + completeGroceryTotal + " on groceries over 5 weeks." + " That is an average of $" + completeGroceryTotal/5 + " per week";// Creating a result variable that contains strings and the expression that calculates the average of the 5 week grocery sum (completeGroceryTotal)
console.log(result);// Printing the result variable to the console
