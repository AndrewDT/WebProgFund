//Andrew Tillett 10/22/13 Assignment Functions: Function Personal

/*Criteria:

Make sure each of the sub-projects follows this list of criteria:
As in the earlier assignments you will need to create code that calculates a result. You may not use the same formulas or code used in previous assignments.
Decide what your code will calculate. This should be an original calculation. In other words you may not use any of the examples mentioned in this class. This will result in an automatic 0.
Information should be collected from the user with prompts
Calculate the result using the variables in an expression (NOT the literal values or numbers)
The result should appear in the browser's console. (Remember to include units like “square feet” or "meters cubed"). This should explain the result as well.
Use a function as part of your code in each sub-project. This function should have at least two parameters and return a value.
 
Each of the following requirements must exist in at least one of the 3 subprojects:
A ternary
An else if
An anonymous function
A normal "named" function
An expression with two arithmetic operators
A function with three parameters.
At least one logical operator


Problem:
Work and school take up a lot of time. School deadlines need to be met, but so does the responsibility of a job. Calculate how many hours you must spend per day on schoolwork based on days left until deadline, hours spent at work, and school workload

Parameters:
School workload
Hours at work
Days left until deadline
*/


var result = calcHours(16, 17, 3);
console.log(result);

//Formula: School workload / (days left - hours at work)
function calcHours(workLoad, timeSpentWork, daysLeft){
	var daysInHours = daysLeft*24
	var calcHours = workLoad / (daysInHours - timeSpentWork);
	return calcHours;
}
